# GitHub Showcase

This repository shows some of the features provided by GitHub.

## Source Control
A version control system, or VCS, tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. As developers make changes to the project, any earlier version of the project can be recovered at any time.

Developers can review project history to find out:
- Which changes were made?
- Who made the changes?
- When were the changes made?
- Why were changes needed?


## Diff Viewing
A diff tool, or a difference tool, compares files line by line, helping users to see what has changed between file versions. It's particularly useful in software development for comparing code files, but can also be used to compare any text-based files.

## Pull Requests
A pull request – also referred to as a merge request – is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.

## Automated Testing
Automated testing is the application of software tools to automate a human-driven manual process of reviewing and validating a software product. Most modern agile and DevOps software projects now include automated testing from inception.
